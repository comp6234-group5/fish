          Landings into the UK by Domestic vs Foreign Vessels
        </h2>

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        When looking at the data of UK landings by UK vessels, UK landings by foreign vessels and foreign landings by
        UK vessels, we can see that right after the EU referendum there was a sudden spike in landings in all three categories
        followed by a steep descent in August and September. This decline in landings happens a little bit earlier compared
        to the previous two years, when the October seems to be the peak month of the year. The decline in UK landings by
        foreign vessels is especially significant as it hits its lowest value in nearly two years. It will be interesting
        to see if the negative trend will continue for the next months or if the landings will pick up like they have
        done in the early months of the previous two years. Will foreign vessels continue to land fish in UK ports or
        will they withdraw in numbers as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the EU?
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        Also of interest is the distribution of the three categories. The landings (quantity in tonnes) in the UK by UK
        vessels is by far greater than the UK landings by foreign vessels. This indicates that the UK does actually have a lot
        of control of their waters in terms of landings. Even more, landings abroad by UK landings is significantly
        higher than UK landings by foreign vessels. It will be interesting to see whether other countries such as France
        and Denmark will impose restrictions on how much UK vessels can fish and sell in their ports as a result of the
        referendum.

          Considering all industries, the UK imports more than it exports and, as a result, it maintains a negative balance of payments a.k.a. a trade deficit. In the context of both a cheaper pound sterling and the re-introduction of duty charges in European trade, exporting could still become more profitable but would this outweigh the costs of more expensive importing? Is the trade deficit getting any smaller?
            How much greater is expenditure in imports than profit from exports? Is the fishing industry one which benefits from exporting more than it spends on importing?
            As can be seen, the deficit is relatively larger in the trade of fish, meaning it woul be particularly hurt by the reintroduction of duty fees as they are outside the European Single Market.

          For already visible consequences, the graph below shows how the referendum may have affected this trade deficit through its impact on the the value of the sterling.
          Explore the effects of the referendum. Now, consider how much greater the deficit would be if all imports were non-EU imports, as they would be if the UK loses access to the Single Market.

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        One way to examine the effect of Brexit on UK fishing prospects is to look at the stock markets. The <a href="http://www.scottishsalmon.com">Scottish Salmon Company</a> <small class="text-muted"><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SSC.OL?p=SSC.OL">(OSE: SSC.OL)</a></small> is a large salmon fishing company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange that mostly relies on fishing grounds in Northern British and Nordic waters, as well as farming salmon in several Scottish seawater lochs. As the largest salmon fishing company in Scotland, their profit is inextricably tied to the fishing regulations in the UK (and by extension, the regulations imposed by the EU). Originally put in place to stop overfishing and encourage sustainable environmental practices, the EU fishing regulations are an oft-cited point of contention for many die-hard Brexiteers. Many in the UK believe that excessively restrictive laws imposed by the EU are suffocating traditional seaside fishing communities - leaving thousands of people out of jobs and devastating rural populations (particularly in Scotland).
        </p>

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but if there is a possibility of deregulation for UK fishing it should be possible to see a shift in investment attitudes towards the UK fishing industry. Notably, the stock for the Scottish Salmon Company is not traded in GBP (£); it is traded in Norwegian Krone, meaning that the stock price is (largely) isolated from the sudden drop in value that most British companies experienced. This acts as a perfect case study into speculative investment in the UK fishing industry as a result of Brexit. As can be seen from the above chart, the volume of shares in the Scottish Salmon Company greatly increases shortly before and after Brexit; in fact, the weeks before and after the referendum contain the days that have the highest number of shares traded in 2016. Not only this, but shortly after the Brexit referendum (i.e. in early July), the stock price for the Scottish Salmon Company increases greatly - by approximately £3 per share, or about 30%. This shows a concrete shift in attitudes towards the UK fishing industry, and perhaps a mark of confidence that EU regulations will be repealed and that the UK fishing industry will rebound.

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        Another way of exploring changing attitudes to the UK fishing industry is to look at historical fish prices at one of the most iconic fish markets in the UK. The <a href="http://www.grimsbyfishmarket.co.uk">Grimsby Fish Market</a> is one of the main focal points of the British fishing industry, and it's internationally renowned for the quality and quantity of fish on display. They also release their historical prices as an open dataset, and this enables insights to be made into the immediate effect of Brexit on fish prices - in other words, the immediate effect of Brexit on the fishing industry.
        </p>

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        Fish prices appear to vary somewhat erratically throughout the year, but it does indeed appear that Haddock prices take a significant drop post-referendum, before recovering to healthier values in mid-August. This could be potentially due to the catastrophic fall in the British Pound (which hit a 30-year low against the USD after the referendum), representing a subsequent loss in the value of fish (international sellers would suddenly look more competitive), or this could also be due to the sharp decrease in landings by foreign vessels in the UK - fish becomes scarcer as international tensions are realised, driving foreign fishing vessels to sell their catches elsewhere.
