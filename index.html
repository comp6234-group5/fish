          <p>
          On the 23rd of June 2016, after one of the most bitter and divisive referendum campaigns in British political history, a small majority of the UK population voted to leave the European Union. As well as the commonly-cited reasons for wanting to leave the EU (such as concern for the economy and opposition to immigration), many also cited restrictions on fishing as an important reason to leave the EU - they believe that EU regulation (imposed onto the UK) is suffocating the British fishing industry and damaging coastal communities.
          </p>

          <p>
          The British fishing industry is (like all EU member states) subject to EU regulations through the “Common Fisheries Policy” (CFP). These regulations include a set of fishing quotas and other limits which have made members of the UK fishing industry claim they have been taken advantage of by other EU countries. Thus, EU departure offers a chance to banish the current “incoherent overfishing regulations” in the eyes of many fishermen.

          Within the Common Fisheries Policy, the main open-sea UK fishing grounds are shared with other countries, including Norway, Iceland and also EU member states. It affects all European fishing fleets but restrictions have been particularly severe in recent years for the demersal or whitefish species (a large proportion of Scottish fishing output). Thus, Brexit could have a significant positive effect on the UK fishing industry.

          <p>
          The consequences of Brexit are not easy to evaluate this soon after the referendum, but we can still see that there is an absolute increase of landings in UK ports by UK vessels - especially around the coast of Scotland. We can expect this to continue grow in the near future - but we still don't know whether this increase was affected by seasonal factors due to the limitations of the data we have.

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        One of the more concrete ways to examine the effect of Brexit on UK fishing prospects is to look at the stock markets. The <a href="http://www.scottishsalmon.com">Scottish Salmon Company</a> <small class="text-muted"><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SSC.OL?p=SSC.OL">(OSE: SSC.OL)</a></small> is a large salmon fishing company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange that mostly relies on fishing grounds in Northern British and Nordic waters, as well as farming salmon in several Scottish seawater lochs. As the largest salmon fishing company in Scotland, their profit is inextricably tied to the fishing regulations in the UK (and by extension, the regulations imposed by the EU). Originally put in place to stop overfishing and encourage sustainable environmental practices, the EU fishing regulations are an oft-cited point of contention for many die-hard Brexiteers. Many in the UK believe that excessively restrictive laws imposed by the EU are suffocating traditional seaside fishing communities - leaving thousands of people out of jobs and devastating rural populations (particularly in Scotland).
        </p>

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but if there is a possibility of deregulation for UK fishing it should be possible to see a shift in investment attitudes towards the UK fishing industry. Notably, the stock for the Scottish Salmon Company is not traded in GBP (£); it is traded in Norwegian Krone, meaning that the stock price is (largely) isolated from the sudden drop in value that most British companies experienced. This acts as a perfect case study into speculative investment in the UK fishing industry as a result of Brexit. As can be seen from the above chart, the volume of shares in the Scottish Salmon Company greatly increases shortly before and after Brexit; in fact, the weeks before and after the referendum contain the days that have the highest number of shares traded in 2016. Not only this, but shortly after the Brexit referendum (i.e. in early July), the stock price for the Scottish Salmon Company increases greatly - by approximately £3 per share, or about 30%. This shows a concrete shift in attitudes towards the UK fishing industry, and perhaps a mark of confidence that EU regulations will be repealed and that the UK fishing industry will rebound.

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        Another way of exploring changing attitudes to the UK fishing industry is to look at historical fish prices at one of the most iconic fish markets in the UK. The <a href="http://www.grimsbyfishmarket.co.uk">Grimsby Fish Market</a> is one of the main focal points of the British fishing industry, and it's internationally renowned for the quality and quantity of fish on display. They also release their historical prices as an open dataset, and this enables insights to be made into the immediate effect of Brexit on fish prices - in other words, the immediate effect of Brexit on the fishing industry.
        </p>

        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        Fish prices appear to vary somewhat erratically throughout the year, but it does indeed appear that Haddock prices take a significant drop post-referendum, before recovering to healthier values in mid-August. This could be potentially due to the catastrophic fall in the British Pound (which hit a 30-year low against the USD after the referendum), representing a subsequent loss in the value of fish (international sellers would suddenly look more competitive), or this could also be due to the sharp decrease in landings by foreign vessels in the UK - fish becomes scarcer as international tensions are realised, driving foreign fishing vessels to sell their catches elsewhere.

            Landings into the UK by Domestic vs Foreign Vessels
          </h2>

          <svg width="960" height="400" class="vessels center-graph"></svg>

          <p>
          When looking at the data of UK landings by UK vessels, UK landings by foreign vessels and foreign landings by
          UK vessels, we can see that right after the EU referendum there was a sudden spike in landings in all three categories
          followed by a steep descent in August and September. This decline in landings happens a little bit earlier compared
          to the previous two years, when the October seems to be the peak month of the year. The decline in UK landings by
          foreign vessels is especially significant as it hits its lowest value in nearly two years. It will be interesting
          to see if the negative trend will continue for the next months or if the landings will pick up like they have
          done in the early months of the previous two years. Will foreign vessels continue to land fish in UK ports or
          will they withdraw in numbers as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the EU? If landings by foreign vessels continue
          to decrease this may result in short-term benefits for the UK; however, in the long-term, a reduced interest by
          foreign vessels to land in the UK may prove to be of negative consequences, e.g. certain type of fish may have to be
          imported instead.
          </p>
          <p>
          Also of interest is the distribution of the three categories. The landings (quantity in tonnes) in the UK by UK vessels is by far greater than the UK landings by foreign vessels. This indicates that the UK does actually have a lot of control of their waters in terms of landings. Even more, landings abroad by UK landings is significantly higher than UK landings by foreign vessels. It will be interesting to see whether other countries such as France and Denmark will impose restrictions on how much UK vessels can fish and sell in their ports as a result of the referendum.

            Considering all industries, the UK imports more than it exports and, as a result, it maintains a negative balance of payments - i.e., a trade deficit. In the context of both a lower-value GBP and the re-introduction of duty charges in European trade, exporting could still become more profitable - but would this be outweighed by the costs of more expensive importing?
            </p>
            <p>
            As can be seen in the charts above, this deficit is relatively larger in the fish trade (as compared to goods and services), meaning that the fish trade could be particularly hurt by the reintroduction of duty fees due to the UK being outside European Single Market.

          Will the trade deficit get any better? For the already visible consequences of the referendum, the graph above shows how it may have affected this trade deficit through its impact on the the value of GBP.

        <h2 class="center-text">Conclusions</h2>
        <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
        In the short term, stock market speculation and increased domestic landings indicate optimism in the UK fishing market (by both fishing communities and investors), and suggest that Brexit may have a positive overall effect on the UK fishing industry. In the longer term, the industry could be negatively affected by a prolonged period of uncertainty in relation to the market as a whole - as well as environmental damage due to the increase of fishing quotas (and other deregulation), and also due to the enhanced trade tariffs due to leaving the Single Market. Without support from the CFP and the ability to access the Single Market, the long term future could be bleak for this industry - especially when considering that deregulation of the fishing industry may lead to severe overfishing and decimation of edible fish species in UK territories. As Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, said: "If Scotland is to have the healthy seas needed to support its fishing industry then it is clear that sustainable quotas will still be needed along with coherent plans for maintaining and preserving the wider marine environment."
