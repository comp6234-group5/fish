            Overview of Landings into the UK by UK Vessels vs Foreign Vessels and Landings Abroad by UK Vessels
        </h4>
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            When looking at the data of UK landings by UK vessels, UK landings by foreign vessels and foreign landings by
            UK vessels, we can see that right after the EU referendum there was a sudden spike in landings in all three categories
            followed by a steep descent in August and September. This decline in landings happens a little bit earlier compared
            to the previous two years, when the October seems to be the peak month of the year. The decline in UK landings by
            foreign vessels is especially significant as it hits its lowest value in nearly two years. It will be interesting
            to see if the negative trend will continue for the next months or if the landings will pick up like they have
            done in the early months of the previous two years. Will foreign vessels continue to land fish in UK ports or
            will they withdraw in numbers as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the EU?
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            Also of interest is the distribution of the three categories. The landings (quantity in tonne) in the UK by UK
            vessels is by far greater than the UK landings by foreign vessels. This indicates that the UK does actually have a lot
            of control of their waters in terms of landings. Even more, landings abroad by UK landings is significantly
            higher than UK landings by foreign vessels. It will be interesting to see whether other countries such as France
            and Denmark will impose restrictions on how much UK vessels can fish and sell in their ports as a result of the
            referendum.
